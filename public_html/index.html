        <h2> WebRTC data channel example</h2>
        
        <p>
            
        This is a somewhat contrived but minimally simple example of using 
        the WebRTC data channel capability. This is effectively unicast UDP sockets
        for the web.<p>
         
        This uses the peerjs package to simplify the code. See http://peerjs.com/
        for details, or http://peerjs.com/docs/ for the API documents. The two
        web pages, webrtcServer.html and webrtcClient.html, require that a peerjs
        "rendezvous" server be running. This server can be run in two ways. The
        first is to rely on a server in the cloud provided by peerjs. However, this
        server uses a non-standard port, and access is blocked by the NPS firewall.
        The other way is to run a peerjs server yourself. This requires that nodejs
        and npm (node package manager) be installed on your machine. Take your pick
        on which is easier for you.
        
        By default the code here assumes you are running a local server. To start
        the server, cd to peerjs-server-master/bin and start the peerjs server
        with (on unix) ./peerjs --port 9000. Initally it may complain that packages
        or modules are missing. Add them with "npm install <packageName>". After
            four or five iterations of this the server will start up.<p>
        
        If you don't want to run the peerjs server and are outside the firewall,
        you can uncomment the line<p>
        
        var serverPeer = new Peer("mv3500", {key:'lwjd5qra8257b9'});
            <p>
        and comment out the line
            <p>
        var serverPeer = new Peer("mv3500", {host: 'localhost', port: 9000, path: '/'});
            <p>
        in webrtcServer.html, and uncomment the line
            <p>
        var client = new Peer({ key: 'lwjd5qra8257b9'}); 
            <p>
        and comment out the line
            <p>
        var client = new Peer({host: 'localhost', port: 9000, path: '/'});
        <p>
        in webrtcClient.html.
        
            <h2> To run</h2>
            
            <list>
            <li> Start the peerjs server with "./peerjs --port 9000"
                
            <li> Open the web page webrtcServer.html. You can just open this with file:///
            <li> Open the web page webrtcClient.html. 
                </list>
                <p>
            The two web pages will exchange information over UDP
