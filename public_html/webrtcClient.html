        <div>This uses peerjs, (peerjs.com), a javascript framework that
            simplifies using WebRTC data channels.  </div><p>
                
            Works in conjuction with the webrtcServer.html page. You should
            run that first. When the webrtcServer page runs, it establishes
            an ID on the server side, "mv3500", that we know to connect
            to. <p>
            
            See the source code, and see http://peerjs.com/docs/ for API information.
