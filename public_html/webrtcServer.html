           // There are two possible ways to connect to the rendezvous
           // server: either a server provided by peerjs in the cloud,
           // or a locally run server. 
           
           // First option: cloud.
           
           // With no URL, this connects to a peerjs server on the cloud,
           // using the provided, public API key. The Peer object is used
           // to provide a rendevous point with other participants. The
           // first argument passed in, in this case "mv3500", should be
           // unique--errors will occur if you provide a non-unique ID.
           // If you omit the ID an ID will be generated for you on the
           // server side.
           
           // Note that the cloud-side server establishes a connection
           // on a non-standard port, I think 9000. This will be blocked
           // inside NPS, which means this will only work outside NPS.
           //var serverPeer = new Peer("mv3500", {key:'lwjd5qra8257b9'});

           // the directory peerjs-server-master/bin with
           // ./peerjs --port 9000.
           // This requires that nodejs and npm be installed on your machine.
           // It may also require the installation of some npm packages. Basically,
           // if you get a "package not found" error, type npm install <packageName>.

           // Not really necessary. Creating the peer object above does not
           // necessarily happen right away. When the object is finished 
           // being created, this function is called to notify us. At this 
           // point we have a connection to the rendevous server.

           // a connection to the ID "mv3500", ie us, this event
           // handler fires. In the callback function we get passed a
           // DataConnection object, which can send and receive data with
           // the peer.
           serverPeer.on('connection', function(connection)
           {
               dataConnection = connection;
               console.log("got connection on server side");
               
               // Set up event handlers for the DataConnection object. 
               // Possible events are data, open, close, and error.
               
               // The other web page has sent us data. Print it out,
               // and send some data back.

        <div>This uses peerjs, (peerjs.com), a javascript framework that
            simplifies using WebRTC data channels.<p>
                
            This can use (by commenting out one line and uncommenting
            another) either a rendezvous server in the cloud or or a 
            rendezvous server run on this host. 
            
            The cloud rendezvous server uses a non-standard port, and the NPS firewall will block
            access. So to use that you'll have to be outside the firewall.<p>
                
            The local server option requires that the peerjs server be started
            up on this machine. That in turn requires that nodejs and npm be
            installed on this machine. In the peerjs-server-master/bin directory,
            start up the server with "./peerjs --port 9000". Intially you may
            get errors on startup that say a package or module is missing. You
            can iteratively solve this by typing "npm install <packageName>"
            to install the missing module. After four of five iterations of this
            the server should start cleanly, and you won't have to issue those
            commands again.<p>
                
            Calling this web page a "server" is a bit of a stretch. What it does
            is connect to the rendezvous server and register a known name
            or ID.  Connections from other web pages to the rendezvous server can request
            a connection to that ID. When that happens the Peer object's 
            'connection' event handler in this page fires, and a DataConnection
            object is passed in the callback.
